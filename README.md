# 1ST PART.- DATA VISUALIZATION WITH TABLEAU

![Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 9 06 05 p m](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/845915e0-6e02-462e-a43b-2910887b342c)


We created some visualizations in Tableau to provide an initial analysis of which stations will be the largest in 2025, as well as to obtain some basic statistics.

# 2ND PART.- MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS

In this section, we will use four different machine learning techniques, taking into account the data we have available, to address various areas of opportunity:

1. User Classification: Uses demographic data (gender and age) to predict user categories and usage patterns (for example, is a younger user more likely to use a bike at night?).
   
2. Route Analysis: We will attempt to create a profile of the most used routes and how they vary by time of day, which could help improve the station system.
  
3. Bicycle Demand Prediction: Analyzes pickup and drop-off patterns to predict which stations will require the most bikes at certain times of the day.

4. User Segmentation: Groups users into different segments based on their usage behavior, which can help with marketing campaigns or service improvements.


## 1. User Classification with Random Forest 

For the model we used demographic data (gender and age) to predict user categories and usage patterns like is a younger user more likely to use a bike at night?)


The model uses Spark in order to read the data.



## 2. Route Analysis:

In this model we used
